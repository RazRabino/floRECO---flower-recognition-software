# floRECO

floRECO is a **ML flower recognition software**, based on Keras and TensorFlow open-source software libraries.
in this project we([Raz Rabino](https://github.com/RazRabino), [Hadas Arbel](https://github.com/HadasahS)) developed a flower recognition software
including simple and convenient to use GUI, floRECO can recognise flowers from this group • bird of paradise ,bougainvillea, 
cyclamen, dahlia, daisy, dandelion, foxglove, frangipani, gentian, geranium, hibiscus, iris, lily, marigold, orchid, passion flower
petunia, rose, sunflower, tulip, wallflower, watercress • with high accuracy

in our project we used the Keras, TensorFlow, TeachAble Machine open-source software libraries and software,
and harvard dataverse flowers images collection, Hackathon Blossom flower images collection, tensorFlow images collection.
